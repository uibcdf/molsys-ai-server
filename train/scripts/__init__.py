"""Training scripts and utilities for MolSys-AI.

This package is intended for:
- data loading and preprocessing,
- training and evaluation loops (e.g. LoRA/QLoRA),
- export of trained adapters and models to Hugging Face Hub.

The implementation is not yet provided; this skeleton exists to anchor
future work on the training pipeline.

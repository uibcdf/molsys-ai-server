# Training notebooks (optional)

This directory can hold Jupyter notebooks used for:

- exploratory data analysis,
- small-scale experiments,
- debugging and visualisation of training runs.

Notebooks here are considered optional and are not required to run or deploy
MolSys-AI. Key training logic should live in `train/scripts/` so that it can be
executed non-interactively.

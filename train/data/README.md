# Training data (pointer only)

This repository should **not** store large training datasets.

Use this directory only for:

- small, synthetic or anonymised examples used in unit tests or documentation,
- metadata files that describe where the real datasets live.

All real datasets (for example, curated documentation Q&A, workflows, or code
examples) should be stored outside the Git repository, following the data
policy in ADR-009.

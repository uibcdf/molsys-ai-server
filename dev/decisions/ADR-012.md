# ADR-012: Strategic vision and scope of MolSys-AI

## Date
2025-12-04
## Status
Accepted

## Context
MolSys-AI is born in a scientific ecosystem that includes:
- MolSysMT (manipulation of molecular systems),
- MolSysViewer (interactive visualization),
- TopoMT (topographical analysis of cavities),
- other UIBCDF tools oriented toward the design of molecules with pharmacological potential.

These libraries share a common philosophy:
- open science,
- reproducibility,
- accessibility,
- clean design,
- modularity.

As the ecosystem grows, it becomes clear that users will need:
- help navigating functional complexity,
- assistance assembling workflows,
- context-adapted examples,
- automatic recommendations,
- reproducible scientific automation.

MolSys-AI arises to meet this need.

## Decision
MolSys-AI is defined as:

> **An autonomous specialized agent, trained to understand, combine, and execute tools from the UIBCDF ecosystem (MolSysMT, MolSysViewer, TopoMT and future tools), able to assist researchers in designing molecular workflows, structural analyses, and reproducible computational tasks.**

The vision incorporates three strategic dimensions:

### 1. Expert technical assistant
- Understands the APIs of MolSysMT, MolSysViewer, TopoMT.
- Helps resolve questions about functions, workflows, formats, units, atomic selection, etc.
- Generates correct, functional code.
- Uses RAG for precise answers based on documentation.

### 2. Engine for scientific-computational workflows
- Can break down a user goal into steps.
- Identifies the appropriate tool.
- Executes tools (safe mode).
- Produces reproducible pipelines.
- Becomes a “unifying layer” of the ecosystem.

### 3. Self-hostable and open model
- Works **locally** with modest resources (e.g., commodity 11 GB GPUs).
- Can be trained and served without depending on external providers.
- Is portable and reproducible.
- Can be embedded into documentation (Sphinx + widget).
- Stays aligned with the open philosophy of the UIBCDF ecosystem.

## Scope (what MolSys-AI **will** do)
- Answer questions about the APIs of MolSysMT, MolSysViewer, TopoMT.
- Generate correct and usable Python code.
- Help assemble scientific workflows.
- Execute tools in a safe environment.
- Integrate with documentation via an embedded chatbot.
- Offer a powerful CLI for advanced users.
- Serve as the entry point to the entire computational ecosystem.

## Out of scope (what MolSys-AI **will not** do)
- It will not replace simulators or molecular dynamics engines.
- It will not perform *de novo* physico-chemical predictions without external tools.
- It will not handle clinical or sensitive biomedical data.
- It will not be a general-purpose model; it stays strictly within the MolSys* ecosystem domain.
- It will not make unsupervised decisions that impact infrastructure (safe mode by default).
- It will not execute shell commands or manipulate the system outside its sandbox.

## Options considered
### 1. Fully generalist agent
**Rejected**:  
It would lose specialization and precision, and increase risk.

### 2. A narrow “assistant-only” (no tools, no autonomy)

**Rejected**:

An assistant that only answers questions (without tool execution, workflow
generation, or reproducible automation) would not address the main pain point
of the MolSys* ecosystem: composing multi-step scientific workflows.

MolSys-AI must go beyond Q&A and become a workflow-oriented agent.

## Consequences

- MolSys-AI will prioritize correctness and reproducibility over “chatty”
  general-purpose behaviour.
- RAG is a first-class capability: answers should be grounded in the MolSys*
  documentation and code.
- The system is safe-by-default:
  - tool execution is explicit,
  - dangerous actions are not enabled unless explicitly designed and opted-in.

## Notes

This ADR describes the strategic scope and does not prescribe a specific model
backend or hardware target. Those decisions are documented in later ADRs
(e.g., ADR-015/016/017).

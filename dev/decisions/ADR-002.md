# ADR-002: Model registry in Hugging Face Hub

## Date
2025-12-04
## Status
Accepted

## Context
MolSys-AI needs a mechanism to:
- store models and LoRAs,
- version them,
- distribute them easily,
- decouple training (node 2) from inference (node 1).

## Decision
Use **Hugging Face Hub**, organization `uibcdf`, as the official model registry.

## Options considered

### 1. Hugging Face Hub (chosen)
**Pros:**
- Native git-based versioning.
- Easy to use with CLI and Python API.
- Allows separating base model and LoRA.
- Excellent integration with frameworks (transformers, TGI, vLLM, llama.cpp).
- Other users can download and run the models locally.
**Cons:**
- Not self-hosted.

### 2. DVC + servidor propio
**Pros:**
- 100% open-source and self-hosted.
- Full control over the infrastructure.

**Cons:**
- Higher operational complexity.
- Does not natively provide a “Hub-like” experience for third parties.

### 3. Git LFS en GitHub
**Pros:**
- Simple integration with the code repository.

**Cons:**
- Size and bandwidth limits.
- Not scalable for large models.

## Justification
Hugging Face Hub is the de facto standard for publishing and versioning models.  
It allows anyone to download MolSys-AI and run it in their own environment.  
It reduces operational complexity and lets us focus on the agent.

## Consequences
- Model repositories are separated from code repositories.
- Clear workflow:
  - Node 2 (training) → push to HF.
  - Node 1 (production) → pull from HF.

## Future notes
- If HF changes policies or data-sovereignty requirements arise, we can migrate to a self-hosted registry (DVC/lakeFS).

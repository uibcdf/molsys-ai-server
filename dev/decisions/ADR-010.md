# ADR-010: Safety and scope of the agent tools

## Date
2025-12-04
## Status
Proposed

## Context
MolSys-AI will execute tools that manipulate molecular systems,
load files, and could in the future launch simulations.

It is necessary to limit what the agent can do.

## Decision
Two modes are defined:

### 1. Safe mode (default)
- The agent **CANNOT**:
  - run shell commands,
  - write outside a sandbox directory,
  - delete files,
  - access external networks.
- It can only call explicitly registered tools.

### 2. Advanced mode (opt-in)
- Will allow:
  - running analysis scripts,
  - generating report files,
  - launching controlled workflows.

## Justification
This prevents destructive or dangerous actions.
Most scientific users do not need dangerous “superpowers”.

## Consequences
- Tools must be **idempotent** and **deterministic**.
- The executor must validate all inputs.

## Future notes
- Define auditing and structured logging of tool-calls.

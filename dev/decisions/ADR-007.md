# ADR-007: License and visibility of the MolSys-AI repository

## Date
2025-12-04
## Status
Proposed

## Context
The main libraries in the UIBCDF ecosystem (MolSysMT, MolSysViewer, TopoMT)
use the MIT license.  
MolSys-AI, however, is not just a library: it combines code, datasets,
trained models, and an autonomous agent.

We must decide whether:

- the MolSys-AI code uses MIT like the rest of the ecosystem, or
- a different license is chosen (Apache-2.0, GPLv3, etc.),
- and whether the repository starts as private or public.

## Decision
We adopt:

- **MIT license** for the *repository code*, for consistency with UIBCDF.
- **Trained models** may have a **different license** (e.g. Apache-2.0 or a “UIBCDF Model License”),
  which will be decided when the first specialized LoRA exists.
- The repository starts **public** from the beginning, since it does not contain sensitive data.

MIT is adopted not only for consistency with the ecosystem, but also because the scientific
and economic value is generated in the uses, workflows, and services built on top of MolSys-AI,
and not in restricting its distribution.

## Options considered

### 1. MIT (chosen)
**Pros**
- Maximum compatibility with the rest of the ecosystem.
- Facilitates adoption by third parties.
- Allows your lab to share the technology without friction.

**Cons**
- Others can reuse and commercialize without being obliged to share improvements.

### 2. Apache-2.0
**Pros**
- Explicit patent protection.
- Stricter than MIT but still open.

**Cons**
- Does not add much value for this specific case.

### 3. GPLv3
**Pros**
- Guarantees that any improvements remain open.

**Cons**
- Incompatible with many commercial uses.
- Would complicate adoption by the scientific community.

### 4. Mantener el repo privado
**Pros**
- Total control.

**Cons**
- Limits community, integrations, and collaboration.

## Justification
The philosophy of the UIBCDF ecosystem is openness.  
Adopting MIT ensures continuity and broad adoption.

## Consequences
- The repository will be open.
- Derived models can have different licenses if desired.

## Future notes
- Evaluate the specific license for the models when the first LoRA appears.

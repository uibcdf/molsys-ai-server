# ADR-009: Data policy for RAG and training

## Date
2025-12-04
## Status
Accepted

## Context
MolSys-AI will include:
- a RAG system,
- specialized LoRA training datasets.

It is essential to define which data can be used.

## Decision
**Allowed** data sources:

1. Public documentation for:
   - MolSysMT
   - MolSysViewer
   - TopoMT
2. **Public** docstrings and source code.
3. Public examples, tutorials, and notebooks.
4. Curated public GitHub issues and discussions.

**Prohibited** sources:

- Clinical, personal, or confidential data.
- Internal logs with private information.
- Internal lab conversations that are not public.
- Files containing paths, keys, or sensitive configurations.

## Options considered
- Include internal data → **rejected** due to risk.
- Restrict to Sphinx docs only → too limiting.

## Justification
Keeping the dataset fully reproducible and open avoids legal issues and makes it easier for others to use the model locally.

## Consequences
- The model can be released under an open license.
- The dataset can be published on Hugging Face datasets.

## Future notes
- Synthetic datasets generated by the model itself may be added.

# ADR-018: Repository split and package naming (server vs client)

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

MolSys-AI is evolving into two deliverables:

1. **Server**: model serving + docs chatbot backend (deployed by the lab).
2. **Client**: end-user CLI (and later a local autonomous agent) installed on user machines.

We want:

- a clean separation of concerns (server does not ship client UX),
- a simple installation experience for users,
- clear naming to avoid package name collisions when publishing.

## Decision

- The **client repository** will be named: `molsys-ai-client`.
- The **server repository** will be named: `molsys-ai-server`.

Publishing and UX:

- The end-user Python distribution published to PyPI will be named: `molsys-ai`.
  - It provides the CLI/agent command: `molsys-ai`.
- The server distribution (if published at all) will be named: `molsys-ai-server`.
  - It must not be published under the same distribution name as the client.

## Consequences

- Users get the simplest experience:
  - `pip install molsys-ai`
  - run `molsys-ai ...`
- Server-side deployments can depend on `molsys-ai-server` (or install from source),
  without risking collisions with the user-facing package.
- GitHub/packaging dependency tracking does not require repo name == package name;
  dependency graphs are derived from manifests (`pyproject.toml`, `environment.yml`, etc.).

## Notes (transition period)

During the transition while `client/` and `server/` code may still coexist in the
same working tree, we must ensure we do not publish conflicting distributions.
When the split is executed, update packaging metadata accordingly.

# MolSys-AI

MolSys-AI is the AI assistant project for the UIBCDF ecosystem:

- MolSysMT
- MolSysViewer
- TopoMT
- and related computational tools (OpenMM, etc.)

MolSys-AI aims to provide:

- An **autonomous agent** that can design and execute workflows using the MolSys* tools.
- A **CLI interface** to interact with the agent from the terminal.
- A **documentation chatbot** embedded in Sphinx/GitHub Pages.
- A flexible **model serving** layer for self-hosted LLMs.

This repository currently contains the initial architecture, decisions and development roadmap.

See:

- `dev/ARCHITECTURE.md` for high-level architecture.
- `dev/ROADMAP.md` for the initial roadmap.
- `dev/CONSTRAINTS.md` for current constraints and assumptions.
- `dev/decisions/` for Architectural Decision Records (ADRs).
